# 🦅 LoRA Fine-Tuning of Falcon LLM for Domain-Specific Question Answering

This project demonstrates how to **fine-tune a Falcon Large Language Model (LLM)** using **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** for a **domain-specific Question Answering (QA)** task. By applying parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), we can adapt a large pre-trained model to specialize in answering questions in a particular field without updating all the weights.

## 🚀 Features

✅ Fine-tune Falcon LLM using LoRA for specific domain QA  
✅ Leverage Hugging Face PEFT libraries for lightweight training  
✅ Demonstrate end-to-end training and inference in a Jupyter Notebook  
✅ Example: customized responses on domain knowledge

## ✨ How It Works

1. **Load Base Model:**  
   Use a pre-trained Falcon model (such as `tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct`) from Hugging Face.

2. **Apply LoRA:**  
   Integrate Low-Rank Adapters to fine-tune select layers, drastically reducing training parameters.

3. **Train on Domain Data:**  
   Provide domain-specific QA pairs to specialize the model.

4. **Inference:**  
   Ask questions, get context-specific answers leveraging the fine-tuned weights.
